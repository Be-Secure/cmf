### Steps to reproduce this example with CMF.
1. Clone this reposirory and install the cmflib 
2. Copy this directory outside the cloned repository to a seperate folder.
3. Update the variables in sample_env and run command `source sample_env`
4. Run command sh initialize.sh
5. Run the following commands 
    1. dvc repro -v dvc.yaml:round_0
    2. dvc repro -v dvc.yaml:active_learning@0
    3. dvc repro -v dvc.yaml:active_learning@1
    4. dvc repro -v dvc.yaml:active_learning@2
6. To see the visualization <br>
    run the command:<br>
    MATCH (a:Execution{pipeline_name:'active-learning-dvc-withdeps'})-[r]-(b) WHERE (b:Dataset or b:Model or b:Metrics) RETURN a,r, b 
    <br> Note - Pipeline name is one of the arguments to demo.py, demo_selection.py, demo_train.py and demo_eval.py
     <br> Default value is active-learning-dvc-withdeps
